# Learning Thai

Hi there, welcome to my repo, wanna teach me new words? Make a PR or create an issue!

Checkout the website, there are flash-cards and a table of all the thai words, I've learned so far!

## Why this project?

I embarked on this project because I noticed a lack of quality online resources for learning Thai. By creating this repository and website, I aim to provide a valuable learning platform for Thai language enthusiasts like you and me ðŸ˜®. Together, we can build a robust collection of Thai words and phrases to enhance our language skills.

So, don't hesitate to get involved! Whether it's adding new words, suggesting improvements, or sharing your learning experiences, your contribution will be greatly appreciated.

Let's make learning Thai an exciting and fulfilling journey! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance.
