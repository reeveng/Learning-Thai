# Learning Thai

It's my intention to every day learn some Thai words. I'll write them down, try to form sentences with them that make sense to a native Thai speaker, maybe eventually I'll understand the writing system too, when I compare the written words and their pronounciations :+1: .

| --- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
