<h1>Learning Thai</h1>

<p>
	It's my intention to every day learn some Thai words. I'll write them down, try to form sentences
	with them that make sense to a native Thai speaker, maybe eventually I'll understand the writing
	system too, when I compare the written words and their pronounciations üëç.

				<th>nr.</th>
				{#each Object.keys(translations[0]) as key}
					<th>{key}</th>

		<tbody>
			{#each translations as translation, index}
				<tr>
					<td>{index + 1}</td>
					{#each Object.values(translation) as value}
						<td>{value}</td>
					{/each}
